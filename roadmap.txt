Roadmap to integrating HashTableMap.java:

So for the assignment last week we submitted a HashTableMap.java. You also likely made a Pair or Node object class to store the key and value.
If possible, we want to be using those classes in our project. So this requires storing a player's data in that Pair/Node object's value field.
One possible way would be to create an ArrayList of objects, and each index of the ArrayList corresponds to a player attribute. (Or it could
also be an ArrayList of Strings and you convert all of the numerical data into Strings before inserting). This ArrayList would then be the "value" of your node
and the player's name would be the "key".

The back end would then manage the database using only HashTableMap methods.

If those who would need to make the changes think you can fix it in time for tonight, that's awesome.
We could also consider turning the project in on Thursday with our changes and take up to a 15% penalty.
Or we could leave as is and turn it in this way tonight.

The important thing is that we decide how to proceed quickly, and let everyone else know what you plan to do and why.
